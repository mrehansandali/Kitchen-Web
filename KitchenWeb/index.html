        <h1>Our Kitchen Remodels Process</h1>
        <p>At JC Construction, we have a unique kitchen remodel process that we follow for our projects in Folsom, CA,
            and beyond.</p>

                <h1>Kitchen Design Search</h1>
                <p>It is crucial that you consider how you want your kitchen to be laid out. We consider how much space
                    you have, as this will determine whether you can put in place structures such as a kitchen island.
                    We recommend kitchen islands for people who have a big and spacious kitchen. However, in such a
                    case, we would still recommend that you get custom cabinets that can comfortably store your items in
                    the kitchen so that you can maintain the overall beautiful look of your kitchen.</p>
                <p>
                    If your kitchen is small, we put much thought into the arrangement of cabinets, appliances, and
                    other items. We strive to ensure that your kitchen looks spacious, even if the space looks
                    relatively small.

                <h1>Determining the Type of Wood to Be Used</h1>
                <p>One of the key things we look at when offering kitchen remodeling services and bathroom remodeling
                    services is the type of wood to be used for the kitchen cabinets. We use different types of wood
                    depending on the type of finish you would like and your style. Some of the wood we use include oak,
                    maple, pine, and the cherry tree.</p>
            </div>

                <img src="child3.png" alt="">
                <h1>Countertop Materials</h1>
                <p>Equally important are the countertop materials that you will use. You should have the right materials
                    as countertops are the most prominent place in the kitchen. The materials we use include natural and
                    artificial stone and plastic coating. Natural stone is quite expensive, but it is the best option
                    for those who want a long-lasting yet beautiful finish for their kitchens. Artificial stones are not
                    as expensive as natural ones, but they still last as long and are a good alternative for those who
                    are seeking something cheaper than natural stone. Plastic is the cheapest of all-out alternatives,
                    but it would not last as long as any of the stones.</p>
